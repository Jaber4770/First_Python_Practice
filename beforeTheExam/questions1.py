#
## ✅ **30 Python Practice Questions**
#
## **Basic Concepts & Operators**
#
#1. Write a Python program to swap two variables without using a third variable.
#2. Write a program that takes a user's name and age and prints:
#   *“Hello <name>, you will be <age+1> next year!”*
#3. Check if a given number is even, odd, or zero.
#4. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle using user input radius.
#5. Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
#
#---
#
#### **Conditionals & Loops**
#
#6. Print all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 7.
#7. Write a program to find the sum of digits of an integer (e.g., 123 → 6).
#8. Write a program to print a multiplication table of a given number.
#9. Count how many vowels appear in a given string.
#10. Reverse a string **without using slicing** (use loops).
#
#---
#
#### **Lists & Strings**
#
#11. Given a list of numbers, remove duplicates without using `set()`.
#12. Sort a list in ascending order **manually** (using loops, not `.sort()`).
#13. Find the second largest number in a list.
#14. Given a sentence, count the number of words.
#15. Merge two lists index-wise (e.g.: `[1,2,3]` + `[4,5,6]` → `[1,4,2,5,3,6]`).
#
#---
#
#### **Functions**
#
#16. Write a function that checks whether a number is prime.
#17. Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.
#18. Write a function that converts a list of integers into a single number.
#    Example: `[1,2,3,4]` → `1234`
#19. Write a function that returns the largest of three numbers.
#20. Write a function that counts how many times a character appears in a string.
#
#---
#
#### **Dictionaries & Tuples**
#
#21. Given a dictionary of student names and marks, find the student with the highest mark.
#22. Write a program that counts word frequency in a sentence and stores results in a dictionary.
#23. Convert two lists into a dictionary:
#    Example: `["a","b","c"]` and `[1,2,3]` → `{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3}`
#24. For a dictionary, print all keys that have even values.
#25. Create a tuple of 10 numbers and find its minimum and maximum without using `min()` or `max()`.
#
#---
#
#### **File Handling**
#
#26. Write a program that reads a text file and counts number of lines, words, and characters.
#27. Write a program to copy contents of one file to another.
#28. Write a program to write user input lines into a file until the user types **"STOP"**.
#
#---
#
#### **Object-Oriented Programming**
#
#29. Create a class `Student` with attributes: name, id, and grade. Add a method to display them.
#30. Create a class `BankAccount` with methods: `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `check_balance()`.
